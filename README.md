# Gold_price_predictor
Gold_price_predictor :A Machine learning model based on random forest regression 
Random forest is a type of supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble methods (bagging) to solve both regression and classification problems.
It runs efficiently on large datasets. Random Forest has a high accuracy than other algorithms. It has an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing
By using this algorithm we bacame able to predict gold price.
